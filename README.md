what is modern c++?
The term Modern C++ became very popular after the release of C++11. What does it mean? First of all, Modern C++ is a set of patterns and idioms that are designed to eliminate the downsides of good old "C with classes", that so many C++ programmers are used to, especially if they started programming in C. C++11 looks way more concise and understandable, which is very important.

What do people usually think of when they speak about Modern C++? Parallelism, compile-time calculation, RAII, lambdas, ranges, concepts, modules, and other equally important components of the standard library (for example, an API to work with the file system). These are all very cool modernizations, and we are looking forward to seeing them in the next set of standards. However, I would like to draw attention to the way the new standards allow writing more secure code. When developing a static analyzer, we see a great number of varying errors, and sometimes we cannot help thinking: "But in modern C++ this could have been avoided". Therefore, I suggest we examine several errors that were found by PVS-Studio in various Open Source projects. Also, we'll see how they can be fixed.
